I was running Microsoft sample HID app, hclient from GitHub.
https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/hid/hclient

Opening the I2C HID-compliant vendor-defined device is OK.
But When I do a WriteFile I got error 0x57.

Any idea how to fix it?
I have checked the report ID and report length.

Thanks.

Resolved by using HidD_SetOutputReport() API.
